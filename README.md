# classification-of-tropical-forage-grass-using-na-ve-bayes-and-kernel-density-estimation
This work presents a machine learning methodology to obtain classification models for nine forage cultivars, subject to moderate and severe water stress. The Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is used together with the Kernel Density Estimation method to obtain the densities used in the classification models.
